# DevSync

DevSync is a platform that connects college developers to projects and collaborators through a streamlined, swipe-based interface. Whether you're looking to join an existing team or find a co-founder for your next side project, DevSync makes it easy to discover and match with like-minded builders.

## 💡 Mission

Finding teammates as a student is hard—especially if you're new to tech spaces, introverted, or not plugged into a campus network. DevSync was created to break down those barriers by making it:

- **Effortless** to discover people and projects.
- **Accessible** to all college students—not just those at hackathons.
- **Intentional** by focusing on meaningful matches, not just resumes.

## 🔐 Exclusivity

To foster a high-trust environment, DevSync restricts access to verified college students by checking your email domain on sign-up. No spam, no noise—just motivated peers.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Create an account** with your school email.
2. **Build your profile** with a bio, resume, and tags.
3. **Swipe** on projects or people based on your interests.
4. **Match** when there's mutual interest—and start building!
